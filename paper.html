                    In superconducting quantum circuits, Josephson junctions are a key component to provide
                    nonlinearity

                    enable

                    Coherent quantum state transfer is a vital step in quantum information processing. Based on the
                    stimulated Raman
                    adiabatic passage (STIRAP), we realize robust quantum state transfer between two superconducting
                    qubits,
                    mediated by a tunable coupler. Utilizing parametric coupling techniques, we construct the STIRAP
                    Hamiltonian by
                    modulating the coupler frequency. A population transfer fidelity of 95:1 ð62:0Þ% is achieved and
                    is
                    consistent
                    with the numerical simulation result of 95.4%. By preparing the initial state in the maximal
                    superposition state
                    of one qubit, we research how the phase of the transferred state is related to the modulation
                    pulses. We
                    also
                    find that the transfer process is robust against the fluctuation of modulation frequency.

                    simulation

                    Monopoles play a center role in gauge theories and topological matter. There are two
                    fundamental
                    types
                    of
                    monopoles in physics: vector monopoles and tensor monopoles. Examples of vector
                    monopoles
                    include
                    the
                    Dirac
                    monopole in three dimensions and Yang monopole in five dimensions, which have been
                    extensively
                    studied
                    and
                    observed in condensed matter or artificial systems. However, tensor monopoles are less
                    studied,
                    and
                    their
                    observation has not been reported. Here we experimentally construct a tunable spin-1
                    Hamiltonian
                    to
                    generate a
                    tensor monopole and then measure its unique features with superconducting quantum
                    circuits. The
                    energy
                    structure
                    of a 4D Weyl-like Hamiltonian with threefold degenerate points acting as tensor
                    monopoles is
                    imaged.
                    Through
                    quantum-metric measurements, we report the first experiment that measures the
                    Dixmier-Douady
                    invariant,
                    the
                    topological charge of the tensor monopole. Moreover, we observe topological phase
                    transitions
                    characterized by
                    the topological Dixmier-Douady invariant, rather than the Chern numbers as used for
                    conventional
                    monopoles in
                    odd-dimensional spaces.

                    Fast, robust two-qubit gate operation with low susceptibility to crosstalk are the key to

                    Based on the geometrical nature of quantum phases, non-adiabatic holonomic quantum control
                    (NHQC)
                    has
                    become a
                    standard technique for enhancing robustness in constructing quantum gates. However, the
                    conventional
                    approach of
                    NHQC is sensitive to control instability, as it requires the driving pulses to cover a fixed
                    pulse
                    area.
                    Furthermore, even for small-angle rotations, all operations need to be completed with the same
                    duration
                    of time.
                    Here we experimentally demonstrate a time-optimal and unconventional approach of NHQC (called
                    TOUNHQC),
                    which
                    can optimize the operation time of any holonomic gate. Compared with the conventional approach,
                    TOUNHQC
                    provides
                    an extra layer of robustness to decoherence and control errors. The experiment involves a
                    scalable
                    architecture
                    of superconducting circuit, where we achieved a fidelity of 99.51% for a single qubit gate using

                    In a superconducting quantum processor with nearest-neighbor coupling, the dispersive
                    interaction
                    between
                    adjacent qubits can result in an effective next-nearest-neighbor coupling whose strength depends
                    on
                    the
                    state of
                    the intermediary qubit. Here, we theoretically explore the possibility of engineering this
                    next-nearest-neighbor
                    coupling to implement controlled two-qubit operations where the intermediary qubit controls the
                    operation on the
                    next-nearest-neighbor pair of qubits. In particular, in a system comprising two types of
                    superconducting
                    qubits
                    with anharmonicities of opposite sign arranged in an -A-B-A- pattern, where the unwanted static

                    coupling
                    between adjacent qubits could be heavily suppressed, a switchable coupling between the
                    next-nearest-neighbor
                    qubits can be achieved via the intermediary qubit, the qubit state of which functions as an

                    switch for
                    this coupling. Therefore, depending on the adopted activating scheme, various controlled

                    operations
                    such as the controlled-iSWAP gate can be realized, potentially enabling circuit depth reductions
                    as
                    to a
                    standard decomposition approach for implementing generic quantum algorithms.

                    For building a scalable quantum processor with superconducting qubits, ZZ interaction is of
                    great
                    concern
                    because its residual has a crucial impact to two-qubit gate fidelity. Two-qubit gates with
                    fidelity
                    meeting the
                    criterion of fault-tolerant quantum computation have been demonstrated using ZZ interaction.
                    However, as
                    the
                    performance of quantum processors improves, the residual static ZZ can become a
                    performance-limiting
                    factor for
                    quantum gate operation and quantum error correction. Here, we introduce a superconducting
                    architecture
                    using
                    qubits with opposite-sign anharmonicity, a transmon qubit, and a C-shunt flux qubit, to address
                    this
                    issue. We
                    theoretically demonstrate that by coupling the two types of qubits, the high-contrast ZZ
                    interaction
                    can
                    be
                    realized. Thus, we can control the interaction with a high on-off ratio to implement two-qubit
                    controlled-Z
                    gates, or suppress it during two-qubit gate operation using XY interaction (e.g., an iSWAP
                    gate).
                    The
                    proposed
                    architecture can also be scaled up to multiqubit cases. In a fixed coupled system, ZZ crosstalk
                    related
                    to
                    neighboring spectator qubits could also be heavily suppressed.

                    The superconducting transmon qubit is currently a leading qubit modality for quantum computing,
                    but
                    gate
                    performance in quantum processor with transmons is often insufficient to support running complex
                    algorithms for
                    practical applications. It is thus highly desirable to further improve gate performance. Due to
                    the
                    weak
                    anharmonicity of transmon, a static ZZ interaction between coupled transmons commonly exists,
                    undermining the
                    gate performance, and in long term, it can become performance limiting. Here we theoretically
                    explore a
                    previously unexplored parameter region in an all-transmon system to address this issue. We show
                    that
                    an
                    feasible
                    parameter region, where the ZZ interaction is heavily suppressed while leaving XY interaction
                    with
                    an
                    adequate
                    strength to implement two-qubit gates, can be found for all-transmon systems. Thus, two-qubit
                    gates,
                    such as
                    cross-resonance gate or iSWAP gate, can be realized without the detrimental effect from static
                    ZZ
                    interaction.
                    To illustrate this, we demonstrate that an iSWAP gate with fast gate speed and dramatically
                    lower
                    conditional
                    phase error can be achieved. Scaling up to large-scale transmon quantum processor, especially
                    the
                    cases
                    with
                    fixed coupling, addressing error, idling error, and crosstalk that arises from static ZZ
                    interaction
                    could also
                    be strongly suppressed.

                    High-quality two-qubit gate operations are crucial for scalable quantum information processing.

                    the gate
                    fidelity is compromised when the system becomes more integrated. Therefore, a low-error-rate,

                    For building a scalable quantum processor with superconducting qubits, the ZZ interaction is of

                    because of relevant for implementing two-qubit gates, and the close contact between gate

                    its

                    using
                    the ZZ
                    interaction. However, as the performance of quantum processor improves, the residual static-ZZ

                    In quantum information processing, it is necessary to transfer quantum state between
                    different
                    systems.
                    Herein,
                    a scheme to transfer quantum state using multi‐passage Landau–Zener–Stückelberg
                    interferometry
                    in
                    three
                    superconducting qubits is proposed. A periodic triangle waveform quickly drives the system
                    across
                    the
                    energy
                    level anticrossing multiple times, inducing multiphoton Rabi oscillations. Using the
                    0‐photon
                    Rabi
                    oscillations,
                    the dynamical quantum state transfer with probability close to 100% is realized. The
                    fidelity of

                    state
                    transfer is insensitive to local distortion of the driving waveform. This scheme can be
                    extended
                    to
                    a
                    system
                    where multiple qubits are coupled to a frequency‐tunable qubit, as a quantum medium. It
                    provides
                    a
                    useful tool
                    for scalable quantum computing.

                    A Berry curvature is an imaginary component of the quantum geometric tensor
                    (QGT) and is well
                    studied in
                    many
                    branches of modern physics; however, the quantum metric as a real component
                    of the QGT is less
                    explored.
                    Here,
                    by using tunable superconducting circuits, we experimentally demonstrate two
                    methods to directly

                    is to
                    detect the excitation rate under weak periodic driving. Furthermore, based

                    Berry-curvature
                    measurements, we explore a topological phase transition in a simulated

                    The work

                    a platform for quantum annealing. Although various scalable architectures with

                    have

                    currently limited to

                    coherent

                    in
                    three-dimensional circuit QED (3D cQED), we propose a flexible and scalable

                    quantum

                    recently

                    resonator-based LHZ
                    annealer, each
                    spin is encoded in the subspace formed by two coherent states of the 3D

                    resonator with
                    opposite phase and thus the fully connected Ising model is mapped onto the

                    local

                    platform
                    for

                    Hopf-link semimetals exhibit exotic gapless band structures with fascinating
                    topological
                    properties,
                    which have
                    never been observed in nature. Here, we demonstrate nodal lines with the
                    topological form of
                    Hopf-link
                    chains in
                    artificial semimetal-bands. Driving superconducting quan- tum circuits with
                    elaborately designed
                    microwave
                    fields, we mapped the momentum space of a lattice to a parameter space of
                    the Hamiltonian for a
                    Hopf-link
                    semimetal. By measuring the energy spectrum, we directly imaged nodal lines
                    in cubic lattices.
                    By
                    tuning
                    the
                    driving fields, we adjusted various parameters of Hamiltonian. Important
                    topological features,
                    such
                    as
                    link-unlink topological transitions and the robustness of the Hopf-link
                    chain structure, were
                    investigated.
                    Moreover, we extracted the linking number by detecting the Berry phase
                    associated with different
                    loops
                    encircling nodal lines. This topological invariant clearly reveals the
                    nontrivial topology of
                    the
                    Hopf-link

                    quantum devices. Published

                    We propose a scheme to simulate the interaction between a two-level
                    system and a classical light
                    field.
                    Under
                    the transversal driving of two microwave tones, the system Hamiltonian
                    is identical to that of
                    the
                    general
                    semi-classical Rabi model. We experimentally realize this Hamiltonian
                    with a superconducting
                    transmon
                    qubit. By
                    tuning the strength, phase and frequency of the two microwave driving

                    provides an effective

                    to

                    We present a model to describe a generic circuit QED system
                    which consists of multiple
                    artificial
                    three-level
                    atoms, namely qutrits, strongly coupled to a cavity mode. When
                    the state transition of the atoms
                    disobey
                    the
                    selection rules the process that does not conserve the number of
                    excitations can happen
                    determinatively.
                    Therefore, we can realize coherent exchange interaction among
                    three or more atoms mediated by
                    the
                    exchange of
                    virtual photons. In addition, we generalize the one cavity mode
                    mediated interactions to the
                    multi-cavity
                    situation, providing a method to entangle atoms located in
                    different cavities. Using
                    experimental
                    feasible
                    parameters, we investigate the dynamics of the model including
                    three cyclic-transition
                    three-level
                    atoms, for
                    which the two lowest-energy levels can be treated as qubits.
                    Hence, we have found that two
                    qubits
                    can
                    jointly
                    exchange excitation with one qubit in a coherent and reversible
                    way. In the whole process, the
                    population in the
                    third level of atoms is negligible and the cavity photon number
                    is far smaller than 1. Our model
                    provides a
                    feasible scheme to couple multiple distant atoms together, which
                    may find applications in
                    quantum

                    Using a multi-layered printed circuit board, we propose a 3D

                    ducting chips, especially chips that contain two-dimensional
                    qubit arrays. In our proposed
                    architecture,
                    the
                    center strips of the buried coplanar waveguides protrude

                    as
                    contacts.
                    Since the contacts extend beyond the surface of the
                    dielectric layer, chips can simply be

                    breaks only the individual T and P symmetries but keeps
