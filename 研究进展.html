In superconducting quantum circuits, Josephson junctions are a key component to provide nonlinearity and enable superconducting qubits. Fabricating junctions with precise critical currents is crucial to defining qubit frequency. Here we suppress the critical current variation of Josephson junctions by varying the critical current density Jc and junction areas. The relative standard deviation of the critical current Ic is controlled to be below 0.8%. This uniform fabrication is promising for realizing scalable superconducting quantum computation

Coherent quantum state transfer is a vital step in quantum information processing. Based on the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), we realize robust quantum state transfer between two superconducting qubits, mediated by a tunable coupler. Utilizing parametric coupling techniques, we construct the STIRAP Hamiltonian by modulating the coupler frequency. A population transfer fidelity of 95:1 ð62:0Þ% is achieved and is consistent with the numerical simulation result of 95.4%. By preparing the initial state in the maximal superposition state of one qubit, we research how the phase of the transferred state is related to the modulation pulses. We also find that the transfer process is robust against the fluctuation of modulation frequency. Numerical simulation confirms that our state transfer scheme is more robust than non-adiabatic protocols

Fast, robust two-qubit gate operation with low susceptibility to crosstalk are the key to scalable quantum-information processing. A parametrically driven gate is inherently insensitive to crosstalk, while superadiabatic control can speed up the gate without losing accuracy. We propose and experimentally implement superadiabatic two-qubit gates using parametric modulation on superconducting quantum circuits. Our results demonstrate the preservation of adiabaticity at a gate speed close to the quantum limit, in addition to robustness against control instability. We demonstrate a controlled-Z gate with an error rate of 5.8%, mainly limited by qubit decoherence, promising future improvement and scalable implementation.

<p id="abstract">
Based on the geometrical nature of quantum phases, non-adiabatic holonomic quantum control (NHQC) has become a standard technique for enhancing robustness in constructing quantum gates. However, the conventional approach of NHQC is sensitive to control instability, as it requires the driving pulses to cover a fixed pulse area. Furthermore, even for small-angle rotations, all operations need to be completed with the same duration of time. Here we experimentally demonstrate a time-optimal and unconventional approach of NHQC (called TOUNHQC), which can optimize the operation time of any holonomic gate. Compared with the conventional approach, TOUNHQC provides an extra layer of robustness to decoherence and control errors. The experiment involves a scalable architecture of superconducting circuit, where we achieved a fidelity of 99.51% for a single qubit gate using interleaved randomized benchmarking. Moreover, a two-qubit holonomic control-phase gate has been implemented where the gate error can be reduced by as much as 18% compared with NHQC.

<p id="abstract">
In a superconducting quantum processor with nearest-neighbor coupling, the dispersive interaction between adjacent qubits can result in an effective next-nearest-neighbor coupling whose strength depends on the state of the intermediary qubit. Here, we theoretically explore the possibility of engineering this next-nearest-neighbor coupling to implement controlled two-qubit operations where the intermediary qubit controls the operation on the next-nearest-neighbor pair of qubits. In particular, in a system comprising two types of superconducting qubits with anharmonicities of opposite sign arranged in an -A-B-A- pattern, where the unwanted static ZZ coupling between adjacent qubits could be heavily suppressed, a switchable coupling between the next-nearest-neighbor qubits can be achieved via the intermediary qubit, the qubit state of which functions as an on-off switch for this coupling. Therefore, depending on the adopted activating scheme, various controlled two-qubit operations such as the controlled-iSWAP gate can be realized, potentially enabling circuit depth reductions as to a standard decomposition approach for implementing generic quantum algorithms.

For building a scalable quantum processor with superconducting qubits, ZZ interaction is of great concern because its residual has a crucial impact to two-qubit gate fidelity. Two-qubit gates with fidelity meeting the criterion of fault-tolerant quantum computation have been demonstrated using ZZ interaction. However, as the performance of quantum processors improves, the residual static ZZ can become a performance-limiting factor for quantum gate operation and quantum error correction. Here, we introduce a superconducting architecture using qubits with opposite-sign anharmonicity, a transmon qubit, and a C-shunt flux qubit, to address this issue. We theoretically demonstrate that by coupling the two types of qubits, the high-contrast ZZ interaction can be realized. Thus, we can control the interaction with a high on-off ratio to implement two-qubit controlled-Z gates, or suppress it during two-qubit gate operation using XY interaction (e.g., an iSWAP gate). The proposed architecture can also be scaled up to multiqubit cases. In a fixed coupled system, ZZ crosstalk related to neighboring spectator qubits could also be heavily suppressed.

<p id="abstract">
The superconducting transmon qubit is currently a leading qubit modality for quantum computing, but gate performance in quantum processor with transmons is often insufficient to support running complex algorithms for practical applications. It is thus highly desirable to further improve gate performance. Due to the weak anharmonicity of transmon, a static ZZ interaction between coupled transmons commonly exists, undermining the gate performance, and in long term, it can become performance limiting. Here we theoretically explore a previously unexplored parameter region in an all-transmon system to address this issue. We show that an feasible parameter region, where the ZZ interaction is heavily suppressed while leaving XY interaction with an adequate strength to implement two-qubit gates, can be found for all-transmon systems. Thus, two-qubit gates, such as cross-resonance gate or iSWAP gate, can be realized without the detrimental effect from static ZZ interaction. To illustrate this, we demonstrate that an iSWAP gate with fast gate speed and dramatically lower conditional phase error can be achieved. Scaling up to large-scale transmon quantum processor, especially the cases with fixed coupling, addressing error, idling error, and crosstalk that arises from static ZZ interaction could also be strongly suppressed.

High-quality two-qubit gate operations are crucial for scalable quantum information processing. Often, the gate fidelity is compromised when the system becomes more integrated. Therefore, a low-error-rate, easy-to-scale two-qubit gate scheme is highly desirable. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new two-qubit gate scheme that exploits fixed-frequency qubits and a tunable coupler in a superconducting quantum circuit. The scheme requires less control lines, reduces cross talk effect, and simplifies calibration procedures, yet produces a controlled-Z gate in 30 ns with a high fidelity of 99.5%, derived from the interleaved randomized benchmarking method. Error analysis shows that gate errors are mostly coherence limited. Our demonstration paves the way for large-scale implementation of high-fidelity quantum operations.

Monopoles play a center role in gauge theories and topological matter. There are two fundamental types of monopoles in physics: vector monopoles and tensor monopoles. Examples of vector monopoles include the Dirac monopole in three dimensions and Yang monopole in five dimensions, which have been extensively studied and observed in condensed matter or artificial systems. However, tensor monopoles are less studied, and their observation has not been reported. Here we experimentally construct a tunable spin-1 Hamiltonian to generate a tensor monopole and then measure its unique features with superconducting quantum circuits. The energy structure of a 4D Weyl-like Hamiltonian with threefold degenerate points acting as tensor monopoles is imaged. Through quantum-metric measurements, we report the first experiment that measures the Dixmier-Douady invariant, the topological charge of the tensor monopole. Moreover, we observe topological phase transitions characterized by the topological Dixmier-Douady invariant, rather than the Chern numbers as used for conventional monopoles in odd-dimensional spaces.

In quantum information processing, it is necessary to transfer quantum state between different systems. Herein, a scheme to transfer quantum state using multi‐passage Landau–Zener–Stückelberg interferometry in three superconducting qubits is proposed. A periodic triangle waveform quickly drives the system across the energy level anticrossing multiple times, inducing multiphoton Rabi oscillations. Using the 0‐photon Rabi oscillations, the dynamical quantum state transfer with probability close to 100% is realized. The fidelity of the state transfer is insensitive to local distortion of the driving waveform. This scheme can be extended to a system where multiple qubits are coupled to a frequency‐tunable qubit, as a quantum medium. It provides a useful tool for scalable quantum computing.

A Berry curvature is an imaginary component of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) and is well studied in many branches of modern physics; however, the quantum metric as a real component of the QGT is less explored. Here, by using tunable superconducting circuits, we experimentally demonstrate two methods to directly measure the quantum metric tensor for characterizing the geometry and topology of underlying quantum states in parameter space. The first method is to probe the transition probability after a sudden quench, and the second one is to detect the excitation rate under weak periodic driving. Furthermore, based on quantum metric and Berry-curvature measurements, we explore a topological phase transition in a simulated time-reversal-symmetric system. The work opens up a unique approach to explore the topology of quantum states with the QGT.

We propose a realizable circuit QED architecture for engineering states of a superconducting resonator off-resonantly coupled to an ancillary superconducting qubit. The qubit-resonator dispersive interaction together with a microwave drive applied to the qubit gives rise to a Kerr resonator with two-photon driv- ing that enables us to efficiently engineer the quantum state of the resonator, such as generation of the Schrödinger cat states for resonator-based universal quantum computation. Moreover, the presented archi- tecture is easily scalable for solving an optimization problem mapped into the Ising spin-glass model and thus serves as a platform for quantum annealing. Although various scalable architectures with supercon- ducting qubits have been proposed for realizing a quantum annealer, the existing annealers are currently limited to the coherent time of the qubits. Here, based on the protocol for realizing a two-photon driven Kerr resonator in three-dimensional circuit QED (3D cQED), we propose a flexible and scalable hardware for implementing a quantum annealer that combines the advantage of the long coherence times attain- able in 3D cQED and the recently proposed resonator-based Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. In the proposed resonator-based LHZ annealer, each spin is encoded in the subspace formed by two coherent states of the 3D microwave superconducting resonator with opposite phase and thus the fully connected Ising model is mapped onto the network of the resonator with local tunable three-resonator interaction. This hardware architecture provides a promising physical platform for realizing a quantum annealer with improved coherence.

<p id="abstract">
Hopf-link semimetals exhibit exotic gapless band structures with fascinating topological properties, which have never been observed in nature. Here, we demonstrate nodal lines with the topological form of Hopf-link chains in artificial semimetal-bands. Driving superconducting quan- tum circuits with elaborately designed microwave fields, we mapped the momentum space of a lattice to a parameter space of the Hamiltonian for a Hopf-link semimetal. By measuring the energy spectrum, we directly imaged nodal lines in cubic lattices. By tuning the driving fields, we adjusted various parameters of Hamiltonian. Important topological features, such as link-unlink topological transitions and the robustness of the Hopf-link chain structure, were investigated. Moreover, we extracted the linking number by detecting the Berry phase associated with different loops encircling nodal lines. This topological invariant clearly reveals the nontrivial topology of the Hopf-link semimetal. Our results provide knowledge for developing materials and quantum devices. Published by AIP Publishing.

We propose a scheme to simulate the interaction between a two-level system and a classical light field. Under the transversal driving of two microwave tones, the system Hamiltonian is identical to that of the general semi-classical Rabi model. We experimentally realize this Hamiltonian with a superconducting transmon qubit. By tuning the strength, phase and frequency of the two microwave driving fields, we simulate the quantum dynamics from weak to extremely strong driving regime. The resulting evolutions gradually deviate from the normal sinusoidal Rabi oscillations with increasing driving strength, in accordance with the predictions of the general semi-classical Rabi model far beyond the weak driving limit. Our scheme provides an effective approach to investigate the extremely strong interaction between a two-level system and a classical light field. Such strong interactions are usually inaccessible in experiments.

<p id="abstract">
We experimentally explore the topological Maxwell metal bands by mapping the momentum space of condensed-matter models to the tunable parameter space of superconducting quantum circuits. An exotic band structure that is effectively described by the spin-1 Maxwell equations is imaged. Three-fold degenerate points dubbed Maxwell points are observed in the Maxwell metal bands. Moreover, we engineer and observe the topological phase transition from the topological Maxwell metal to a trivial insulator, and report the first experiment to measure the Chern numbers that are higher than one.

<p id="title">Circuit QED with qutrit: coupling three or more atoms via virtual photon exchange</p>

<p id="abstract">
We present a model to describe a generic circuit QED system which consists of multiple artificial three-level atoms, namely qutrits, strongly coupled to a cavity mode. When the state transition of the atoms disobey the selection rules the process that does not conserve the number of excitations can happen determinatively. Therefore, we can realize coherent exchange interaction among three or more atoms mediated by the exchange of virtual photons. In addition, we generalize the one cavity mode mediated interactions to the multi-cavity situation, providing a method to entangle atoms located in different cavities. Using experimental feasible parameters, we investigate the dynamics of the model including three cyclic-transition three-level atoms, for which the two lowest-energy levels can be treated as qubits. Hence, we have found that two qubits can jointly exchange excitation with one qubit in a coherent and reversible way. In the whole process, the population in the third level of atoms is negligible and the cavity photon number is far smaller than 1. Our model provides a feasible scheme to couple multiple distant atoms together, which may find applications in quantum information processing.

<p id="abstract">
Using a multi-layered printed circuit board, we propose a 3D architecture suitable for packaging supercon- ducting chips, especially chips that contain two-dimensional qubit arrays. In our proposed architecture, the center strips of the buried coplanar waveguides protrude from the surface of a dielectric layer as contacts. Since the contacts extend beyond the surface of the dielectric layer, chips can simply be flip-chip packaged with on-chip receptacles clinging to the contacts. Using this scheme, we packaged a multi-qubit chip and per- formed single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gate operations. The results indicate that this 3D architecture provides a promising scheme for scalable quantum computing.

<p id="title">Realizing and manipulating space-time inversion symmetric topological semimetal bands with superconducting quantum circuits</p>

<p id="abstract">
We have experimentally realized novel space-time inversion (P-T) invariant Z2-type topological semimetal-bands, via an analogy between the momentum space and a controllable parameter space in superconducting quantum circuits. By measuring the whole energy spectrum of system, we imaged clearly an exotic tunable gapless band structure of topological semimetals. Two topological quantum phase transitions from a topological semimetal to two kinds of insulators can be manipulated by continuously tuning the different parameters in the experimental setup, one of which captures the Z2 topology of the PT semimetal via merging a pair of nontrivial Z2 Dirac points. Remarkably, the topological robustness was demonstrated unambiguously, by adding a perturbation that breaks only the individual T and P symmetries but keeps the joint PT symmetry. In contrast, when another kind of PT -violated perturbation is introduced, a topologically trivial insulator gap is fully opened.
