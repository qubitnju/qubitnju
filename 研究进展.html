<p id="abstract">
In quantum information processing, it is necessary to transfer quantum state between different systems. Herein, a scheme to transfer quantum state using multi‐passage Landau–Zener–Stückelberg interferometry in three superconducting qubits is proposed. A periodic triangle waveform quickly drives the system across the energy level anticrossing multiple times, inducing multiphoton Rabi oscillations. Using the 0‐photon Rabi oscillations, the dynamical quantum state transfer with probability close to 100% is realized. The fidelity of the state transfer is insensitive to local distortion of the driving waveform. This scheme can be extended to a system where multiple qubits are coupled to a frequency‐tunable qubit, as a quantum medium. It provides a useful tool for scalable quantum computing.

We simulated highly tunable Weyl-semimetal bands using superconducting quantum circuits. Driving the superconducting quantum circuits with microwave fields, we mapped the momentum space of a lattice to the parameter space, realizing the Hamiltonian of a Weyl semimetal. By measuring the energy spectrum, we directly imaged the Weyl points, whose topological winding numbers were further determined from the Berry curvature measurement. In addition, we manipulated the band structure with an additional pump microwave field, producing a momentum-dependent Weyl-point energy together with an artificial magnetic field, which are indispensable for generating chiral magnetic topological currents in some special Weyl semimetals and may have significant impact on topological physics.

<p id="abstract">
A Berry curvature is an imaginary component of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) and is well studied in many branches of modern physics; however, the quantum metric as a real component of the QGT is less explored. Here, by using tunable superconducting circuits, we experimentally demonstrate two methods to directly measure the quantum metric tensor for characterizing the geometry and topology of underlying quantum states in parameter space. The first method is to probe the transition probability after a sudden quench, and the second one is to detect the excitation rate under weak periodic driving. Furthermore, based on quantum metric and Berry-curvature measurements, we explore a topological phase transition in a simulated time-reversal-symmetric system. The work opens up a unique approach to explore the topology of quantum states with the QGT.

We propose and demonstrate experimentally the arbitrary state-transfer in a qubit by using a superadiabatic approach in a superconducting circuit. We encode the qubit in a time-dependent dark state generated by an applied microwave field, speeding up the adiabatic evolution by transitionless quantum driving algorithms. This approach is realized experimentally in a qutrit system, which consists of a qubit and an ancil- lary level. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the implementation and measure the fidelity of transfer operation by using randomized benchmarking technique.

<p id="abstract">
We propose a realizable circuit QED architecture for engineering states of a superconducting resonator off-resonantly coupled to an ancillary superconducting qubit. The qubit-resonator dispersive interaction together with a microwave drive applied to the qubit gives rise to a Kerr resonator with two-photon driv- ing that enables us to efficiently engineer the quantum state of the resonator, such as generation of the Schrödinger cat states for resonator-based universal quantum computation. Moreover, the presented archi- tecture is easily scalable for solving an optimization problem mapped into the Ising spin-glass model and thus serves as a platform for quantum annealing. Although various scalable architectures with supercon- ducting qubits have been proposed for realizing a quantum annealer, the existing annealers are currently limited to the coherent time of the qubits. Here, based on the protocol for realizing a two-photon driven Kerr resonator in three-dimensional circuit QED (3D cQED), we propose a flexible and scalable hardware for implementing a quantum annealer that combines the advantage of the long coherence times attain- able in 3D cQED and the recently proposed resonator-based Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. In the proposed resonator-based LHZ annealer, each spin is encoded in the subspace formed by two coherent states of the 3D microwave superconducting resonator with opposite phase and thus the fully connected Ising model is mapped onto the network of the resonator with local tunable three-resonator interaction. This hardware architecture provides a promising physical platform for realizing a quantum annealer with improved coherence.

<p id="abstract">
Hopf-link semimetals exhibit exotic gapless band structures with fascinating topological properties, which have never been observed in nature. Here, we demonstrate nodal lines with the topological form of Hopf-link chains in artificial semimetal-bands. Driving superconducting quan- tum circuits with elaborately designed microwave fields, we mapped the momentum space of a lattice to a parameter space of the Hamiltonian for a Hopf-link semimetal. By measuring the energy spectrum, we directly imaged nodal lines in cubic lattices. By tuning the driving fields, we adjusted various parameters of Hamiltonian. Important topological features, such as link-unlink topological transitions and the robustness of the Hopf-link chain structure, were investigated. Moreover, we extracted the linking number by detecting the Berry phase associated with different loops encircling nodal lines. This topological invariant clearly reveals the nontrivial topology of the Hopf-link semimetal. Our results provide knowledge for developing materials and quantum devices. Published by AIP Publishing.

We propose a scheme to simulate the interaction between a two-level system and a classical light field. Under the transversal driving of two microwave tones, the system Hamiltonian is identical to that of the general semi-classical Rabi model. We experimentally realize this Hamiltonian with a superconducting transmon qubit. By tuning the strength, phase and frequency of the two microwave driving fields, we simulate the quantum dynamics from weak to extremely strong driving regime. The resulting evolutions gradually deviate from the normal sinusoidal Rabi oscillations with increasing driving strength, in accordance with the predictions of the general semi-classical Rabi model far beyond the weak driving limit. Our scheme provides an effective approach to investigate the extremely strong interaction between a two-level system and a classical light field. Such strong interactions are usually inaccessible in experiments.

<p id="title">Circuit QED with qutrit: coupling three or more atoms via virtual photon exchange</p>
<p id="authors">Peng Zhao, Xinsheng Tan, Haifeng Yu, Shi-Liang Zhu, Yang Yu</p>
<p id="dateline">(Submitted on 25 Jun 2017)</p>
<p id="abstract">
We present a model to describe a generic circuit QED system which consists of multiple artificial three-level atoms, namely qutrits, strongly coupled to a cavity mode. When the state transition of the atoms disobey the selection rules the process that does not conserve the number of excitations can happen determinatively. Therefore, we can realize coherent exchange interaction among three or more atoms mediated by the exchange of virtual photons. In addition, we generalize the one cavity mode mediated interactions to the multi-cavity situation, providing a method to entangle atoms located in different cavities. Using experimental feasible parameters, we investigate the dynamics of the model including three cyclic-transition three-level atoms, for which the two lowest-energy levels can be treated as qubits. Hence, we have found that two qubits can jointly exchange excitation with one qubit in a coherent and reversible way. In the whole process, the population in the third level of atoms is negligible and the cavity photon number is far smaller than 1. Our model provides a feasible scheme to couple multiple distant atoms together, which may find applications in quantum information processing.

<p id="abstract">
Using a multi-layered printed circuit board, we propose a 3D architecture suitable for packaging supercon- ducting chips, especially chips that contain two-dimensional qubit arrays. In our proposed architecture, the center strips of the buried coplanar waveguides protrude from the surface of a dielectric layer as contacts. Since the contacts extend beyond the surface of the dielectric layer, chips can simply be flip-chip packaged with on-chip receptacles clinging to the contacts. Using this scheme, we packaged a multi-qubit chip and per- formed single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gate operations. The results indicate that this 3D architecture provides a promising scheme for scalable quantum computing.

<p id="authors">Xinsheng Tan, Yuxin Zhao, Qiang Liu, Guangming Xue, Haifeng Yu, Zidan Wang, Yang Yu</p>
<p id="dateline">(Submitted on 6 Feb 2017)</p>
<p id="abstract">
We have experimentally realized novel space-time inversion (P-T) invariant Z2-type topological semimetal-bands, via an analogy between the momentum space and a controllable parameter space in superconducting quantum circuits. By measuring the whole energy spectrum of system, we imaged clearly an exotic tunable gapless band structure of topological semimetals. Two topological quantum phase transitions from a topological semimetal to two kinds of insulators can be manipulated by continuously tuning the different parameters in the experimental setup, one of which captures the Z2 topology of the PT semimetal via merging a pair of nontrivial Z2 Dirac points. Remarkably, the topological robustness was demonstrated unambiguously, by adding a perturbation that breaks only the individual T and P symmetries but keeps the joint PT symmetry. In contrast, when another kind of PT -violated perturbation is introduced, a topologically trivial insulator gap is fully opened.
